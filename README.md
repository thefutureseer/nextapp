bash:  
Make sure you have Next.js installed globally on your system. You can install it using npm or yarn with the following command:  
npm install -g create-next-app  

Navigate to the root folder of your existing React app and run the following command to create a new Next.js app:

lua
Copy code
npx create-next-app . (The dot to make sure its created where you are instead of naming a new folder to put it in)
